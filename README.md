## Repo naming convention

### Main repo with username
The intended use for this repo is your personal input. 
Eventually there will be more options, yet, for now, 
the options will be limited.

**The options will include:**
* Support
* Reject
* Statement
* Question
* Response
* Document (idea development v. sentence statement)

### Small groups repos
The intended use for this repo is to form small group to work in. 
Since documentation is the primary focus of this Repo, the process
is less involve than with a software project.

The gist of it is asynchronous & version control development of an idea
w/ others all self-selected.

More on GitHub and git as demands requires.
